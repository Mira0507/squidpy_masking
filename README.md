# squidpy_masking

This repository is designed to demonstrate fluorescence image masking
for Visium analysis using the 
[squidpy (Palla, Spitzer et al., 2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01358-2) 
package in Python.

## Package installation

Packages were installed using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager.
For more detailed information about packages and versions, refer to 
the `env.archived.yaml` file.

## Workflow

1. **Image Loading**

- Scenario 1: Loading demo images using `squidpy.datasets.visium_fluo_image_crop`.
- Scenario 2: Loading `tif` and `tiff` images converted from the `vsi` format, 
taken using the Olympus VS200 scanner.

2. **Smoothing**: Apply [Gaussian smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) 
with `squidpy.im.process` to reduce noise.  

3. **Segmentation**: Segment images using the following approaches
   - [Otsu thresholding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu's_method)
   - [Watershed segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing))

4. **Visualization**: Compare pre/post-smoothing and pre/post-segmentation results.  

## Scripts

- `scripts/segmentation.Rmd`: Masking demo fluorescence images from 
`squidpy.datasets.visium_fluo_image_crop`.
- `scripts/image_conversion_<sample>.Rmd`: Converting user images from `vsi` to `tif` 
using the `bftools` package.
- `scripts/segmentation_<sample>_<dimension>.Rmd`: Masking `tif` fluorescence images 
using Squidpyâ€™s default segmentation workflow with different cropping dimensions
